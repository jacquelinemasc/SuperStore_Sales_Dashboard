## Key Objectives
1.	Develop an Interactive Dashboard: Create a dynamic and visually rich Power BI report to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Average Delivery Time.
2.	Performance Analysis: Analyze sales trends Year-over-Year (YoY) and segment performance by Region, Customer Segment, Category, and State to pinpoint critical business drivers.
3.	Customer Segmentation: Implement Age-based segmentation to identify high-value customer demographics for targeted marketing campaigns.
4.	Sales Forecasting: Utilize Power BI's built-in time series capabilities to forecast future sales trends.

##	Methodology & Technical Stack
Data Preparation: Power BI was used for robust data cleaning, type conversion, and structuring the data model prior to analysis.

Data Modeling & Analysis: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) served as the core engine for creating all custom measures like Total Sales, Sum of Profit, Avg. Delivery, and YoY calculations.

Forecasting: The Power BI Forecast Feature was applied to the "Sales by Order Date" visuals to generate forward-looking projections using built-in time series analysis.

Visualization & Reporting: Power BI Desktop was used to build a multi-page, interactive dashboard utilizing slicers, drill-throughs, and optimized visualizations for business intelligence reporting.

## Key Dashboard Insights
The dashboard delivers real-time visibility into the following performance areas:
•	Financial KPIs: Quick view of total sales (341K), profit (27K), and quantity.
•	Geographic Performance: Identification of top-selling states (Washington, Virginia), and sales breakdown by Region (Central, East, South, West).
•	Customer & Product Analysis: Breakdown of sales by Category (Office Supplies, Furniture, Technology), Customer Segment, and Subcategory (Chairs, Binders, Phones).
•	Logistics: Analysis of sales by Ship Mode (Standard Class being dominant).
•	Time Series: YoY Sales and Profit trend lines show seasonality, with the time-based charts clearly showing historical data and a forecasted future trend.
